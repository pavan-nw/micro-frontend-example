# Micro-frontend Example

This example demos a basic host application loading remote component.

- `app1` is the host application.
- `app2` standalone application which exposes component.
- `app3` standalone application which exposes component.

# Running Demo

Run `npm start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001, 3002 & 3003 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (HOST)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (STANDALONE REMOTE)
- [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003/) (STANDALONE REMOTE)
